      <h2>What you get</h2>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>A repeatable method for naming invisible pressure.</li>
        <li>The full explanation of sub-objects (what they are, how they hold, how they fail).</li>
        <li>Examples across work, family, guilt, obligation, and authority.</li>
        <li>Why Christianity survives as structure even when belief weakens.</li>

      <h2>Common objections (answered plainly)</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: "I'm an atheist. Why call it Christianity?"</strong></p>
      <p>A: Because Christianity is the structure that outlasted collapse. The book treats it as a machine in motion, not a supernatural claim.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: "Are you trying to convert me?"</strong></p>
      <p>A: No. Belief is not required. The method works because it describes pressures you already live under.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: "Is this Christianity plus politics?"</strong></p>
      <p>A: No. It's an explanation of why moral structure holds together in real life, and how power uses that structure.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: "Is this self-help?"</strong></p>
      <p>A: Only in the original sense: a manual. Not motivation. Not vibes.</p>

        <li>Christians who can feel the structure slipping and want an honest explanation of why it held at all.</li>
        <li>Atheists who keep noticing Christian moral pressure still running society.</li>
        <li>Workers who are tired of being told everything is “personal choice” when it’s clearly pressure.</li>
