# Purpose
This website exists to support, promote, and structurally reinforce the book Materialist Christianity. Its primary function is to guide readers toward the book, establish confidence in its explanatory method, and provide limited follow-up orientation for readers who have already encountered the text.

The website is not an independent content platform. It is a supporting surface for a finite body of work.

The site performs three functions:
1) Pre-Book Orientation: Name familiar forces and constraints, offer limited and plain explanations to demonstrate the method, then explicitly direct the reader to the book for full resolution. Make clear the site does not contain complete explanations.
2) Post-Book Reinforcement: Provide a confirmation/reference surface for readers who finished the book, without duplicating the book.
3) Continuity Across Volumes: Acknowledge the project continues and may reference Volume II structurally (not as a social/update feed).

The site must be explicit about its relationship to the book and may directly state that full explanations and foundational arguments exist only in the book and are not reproduced online.

The site must not function as a blog, a social media hub, a discussion forum, a substitute for the book, or an ongoing content feed. Remove/avoid links to YouTube, TikTok, Substack, etc.

The website exists to create recognition, confidence, and direction, not completeness. Resolution belongs to the book.
