# Stop Sign

A symbol can make you hesitate in complete solitude.

- What you notice: You adjust your behavior without being asked.
- What it does: It produces obedience before belief.
- Why it persists: Because the structure is enforced socially, not personally.

Proof from the book: “A stop sign on an abandoned road is still real if it makes a driver hesitate.”
