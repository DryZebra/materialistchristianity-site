This is a direct confrontation between the administrative class (the Pharisees) and the synthesis (Christ). The Pharisees attempt to trap him using a highly specific legal code regarding divorce—which, in the ancient economic grid, was primarily a mechanism of property control and the financial discarding of vulnerable labor (women).

They expect a theological or legal debate. They want to argue the footnotes of Phase B (the era of extraction, complex law, and social hierarchy).

Christ refuses to engage with their localized legal framework. Instead, he grabs the absolute baseline established in Genesis 1:1 and uses it as a wrecking bar to collapse their entire premise.

First, he diagnoses their law as a symptom of entropy: *"because of the hardness of your hearts."* He identifies the complex legal code not as divine perfection, but as a mechanical concession to human friction and corruption. The law only exists because the system is already broken.

Second, he pulls the lever: *"but from the beginning it was not so."* By invoking the original material baseline, Christ completely invalidates the authority of the administrative class. He demonstrates that their current legal and economic system is an artificial deviation from the factory settings. The answer to their trap is not found by interpreting the corrupt law better; the answer is to abolish the concession entirely and return to the original, uncorrupted structure. He uses the timeline to short-circuit their authority, proving that the end goal (the synthesis) is the restoration of the beginning.
