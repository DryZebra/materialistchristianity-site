## THE SCHEMATICS (Matthew 19:8)

### 1. The Friction (The Hardness of Heart)
**Raw Greek:** sklērokardian (σκληροκαρδίαν)
**Morphology:** Noun, Accusative, Singular, Feminine
**The Physics:** This is a compound of sklēros (hard, stiff, dried out) and kardia (heart/core). In industrial terms, this is entropy. It is a material that has lost its plasticity and become brittle. Christ is diagnosing the Pharisaic law not as a divine ideal, but as a mechanical patch applied to a failing, brittle system.

### 2. The Anchor (The Beginning)
**Raw Greek:** archēs (ἀρχῆς)
**Morphology:** Noun, Genitive, Singular, Feminine
**The Physics:** This is the exact Greek word used in the Septuagint translation of Genesis 1:1 ("En archē"). It means the foundation, the origin, the first structural node. Christ is explicitly grabbing the Genesis 1:1 wire. He is bypassing all the legal code added in Phase B and plugging his argument directly into Phase A.

### 3. The Absolute Negative
**Raw Greek:** ou (οὐ)
**Morphology:** Adverb, Negative
**The Physics:** This is not a soft "no." It is the absolute, objective negative. It means "factually, materially, this is not the case."

### 4. The Core Verb (The Manufacture)
**Raw Greek:** gegonen (γέγονεν)
**Morphology:** Verb, Perfect, Active, Indicative
**The Physics:** This is the kill shot. The verb is ginomai, which does not mean a magical poof into existence. It means to be generated, to be manufactured, to come into being through a process.
Crucially, it is in the Perfect Tense. In Greek, the perfect tense describes an action that was completed in the past but has a continuous, ongoing structural result in the present.

### The Vector Calculation:
When you put the gears together—ap' archēs de ou gegonen houtōs—Christ is not giving a philosophical opinion on marriage. He is making a structural, historical declaration:
"From the foundational baseline (archēs), the system was absolutely not (ou) manufactured to operate like this (gegonen houtōs)."
He is pointing to the blueprint to prove the current machine is built wrong.
