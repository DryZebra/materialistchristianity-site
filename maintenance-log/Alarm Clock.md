# Alarm Clock

The demand shows up before the day does.

- What you notice: You adjust your behavior without being asked.
- What it does: It produces obedience before belief.
- Why it persists: Because the structure is enforced socially, not personally.

Proof from the book: “But what wakes you isn’t just the sound, it’s the demand behind it.”
