If the New Testament were an idealist, mystical document, it would start with a spirit descending from the clouds, completely disconnected from the dirt.

Instead, the very first line of the New Testament is a **Material Ledger**.

It is a genealogical record. It firmly anchors the "synthesis" (Christ) not in the abstract heavens, but in the physical, biological history of a specific, material people. By explicitly linking him to David (the apex of the earthly kingdom's political power) and Abraham (the original recipient of the physical land and the covenant), the text demands that Christ be understood as the physical culmination of thousands of years of historical and biological friction.

He is not an alien inserted into the timeline. He is the final product manufactured by the timeline itself. The "generation" (genesis) is a biological, historical chain of cause and effect. The synthesis requires the friction of the past to generate its torque.
