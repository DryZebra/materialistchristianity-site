# Invisible Judge

You can feel judged with nobody in the room.

- What you notice: You adjust your behavior without being asked.
- What it does: It produces obedience before belief.
- Why it persists: Because the structure is enforced socially, not personally.

Proof from the book: “It's a sub-object projected into your own mind.”
