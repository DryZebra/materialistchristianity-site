# Dinner Table

The room corrects you before anyone speaks.

- What you notice: You adjust your behavior without being asked.
- What it does: It produces obedience before belief.
- Why it persists: Because the structure is enforced socially, not personally.

Proof from the book: “A joke is told. Someone laughs too loud. The tone shifts. A boundary was crossed.”
